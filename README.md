# Reson8

### Basic commands
mvn clean install  
mvn clean test  

### Running the application
Navigate to the /docker/database folder and do "docker compose up -d" to start the database.
Afterwards you can boot up the backend by running the main method in the Reson8Application class.

The resources folder in the root contains a postman collection to manually test the PracticeRoutine controller.  

### About the application
This is meant as a personal practice tracker, and I intend to display statistics of certain practice routines, improvements, and other fun stuff like that.
